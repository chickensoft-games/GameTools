/// <param name="Screen">The Godot screen index for the display the window was
/// on at the time this information was determined.</param>
/// <param name="SystemScale">What Godot believe the system scale factor is.
/// This is completely unreliable on macOS, and can break on Windows in
/// multi-monitor, mixed-DPI scenarios. In general, prefer
/// <see cref="DisplayScale"/> if you want to take into account the user's
/// desired display scaling.</param>
/// <param name="WindowScale">A scale factor used in combination with
/// <see cref="CorrectionFactor" /> to determine window size independently
/// of the scale factor. On macOS, this is the retina multiplier which scales
/// all logical resolutions.</param>
/// <param name="DisplayScale">The actual display scale for macOS and Windows,
/// as reported by CoreGraphics on macOS and Win32 API's on Windows. Requires
/// Windows 10+ as we need newer Win32 API's that work around the fact that
/// Godot does not support per-monitor DPI awareness.</param>
/// <param name="ThemeScale">The native resolution height divided by the
/// theme's design resolution height.</param>
/// <param name="ContentScaleFactor">The new content scale factor
/// needed to scale the theme correctly based on the native resolution of the
/// display. Applying this scale factor will result in your application
/// appearing the same size regardless of the display's actual scale
/// factor.</param>
/// <param name="CorrectionFactor">Correction factor to convert from Godot's
/// understanding of the virtual window device-independent pixels (DIPs â€” which
/// can be completely wrong) to the actual amount needed to appear consistently.

/// and Windows, as determined by CoreGraphics on macOS and Win32 API's on
/// Windows.</param>
/// <param name="Resolution">The resolution of the window, as determined by
/// Godot. This is often the logical resolution and can be in an unintuitive
/// coordinate space if other monitors are involved or you're on macOS.
